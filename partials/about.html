        I’m Aaron Ruddick, a producer and songwriter based in Northern California. I approach music by listening first, focusing on groove, movement, and how a song feels in the body before worrying about polish or tools. When something is working, I can feel it settle, and when it is not, it is usually because there is too much competing for space.

        My work focuses on helping artists move songs from rough or uncertain into something balanced, clear, and ready to be shared. That might mean tightening the groove, aligning vocals, cleaning up low end and mids, or using pitch and tone tools carefully so the performance stays human. Sometimes it means being honest about what can be fixed and what might benefit from a better recording, while staying supportive of an artist’s budget and situation.

        I tend to work in two modes. One is rhythmic and danceable, where groove and feel lead the way. The other is songwriter driven, where the story and emotion guide production and mix choices. In both cases, my goal is the same: to help the song breathe and feel good to listen to, not just look correct on a meter.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m currently studying music production at Berklee and building collaborative experience by working with fellow students, independent artists, and disabled veterans. I care deeply about trust in the creative process, listening without ego, and helping artists finish something they can stand behind.
